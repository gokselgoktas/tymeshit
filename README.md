# Tymeshit
An ominous fake but believable timesheet generator.

## Introduction
You love timesheets but can't remember how hard you worked during all those amazing days full of heavy labor?<br>
Or maybe, you hate timesheets but have to fill them in anyway?

Fret not.<br>
**For üïêüí© is here!**

## Usage
1. Fire up your favorite web browser and go to <https://tymeshit.herokuapp.com>.
2. Click on good ol' Dusty, the ever smiling and friendly shooting star located at the bottom right of the page.
    1. Wait for Dusty to wake up while sprinkling its very own special stardust all over your display, generate your
       data and give you the thumbs up.
    2. Once Dusty says _goodbye_ you're all set, and your freshly minted timesheet in Google Docs compatible format
       should be waiting for you on your clipboard. **Now, isn't that awesome?**
3. Go to any Google Sheets document and paste your totally legit timesheet.

## Advanced Usage
Are the above instructions simply not good enough?<br>
Maybe you aren't satisfied with consistent, albeit totally fake, working hours that make you look diligent. Maybe you
would much rather be an erratic and unpredictable shipwreck?<br>
Perhaps you are trying to fake your timesheets for the months or even the years you haven't even worked yet?<br>
Do you happen to be a pathological liar?<br>
**We got you covered!**

Simply click on Mr. Poopers, the cute but jumpy pile of poo located to the top right of the page. Doing so opens up a
configuration panel where you can easily change the month and the year for which you are generating your timesheets.

The _fakery_ slider is there for the worst and the best among us; it controls the amount of steadiness in your hours.
Going for the leftmost position on the slider will get you a steady working month at around 7.5h per day, for every
working day of the month. Whereas, going for the rightmost position on the slider will make your working hours look more
like a cocaine fueled trading session on the Wall St.

The friendly emoji to the left of the _fakery_ slider tells you how you should be feeling for selecting that specific
setting. **Now, that is a feature like no other, it's a builtin shrinkologist!**

## Trivia
- The clock emoji behind Mr. Poopers shows the current local time accurate to the nearest thirty minutes. It's true.
  Imagine getting a fifteen minute accuracy for timekeeping from an emoji.
- The inspiration for the design came from a rather well known design agency coming up with some funky and unpleasantly
  amusing design ideas for our new startup.

## Disclaimer
This is obviously a joke but it was a great and also fun learning opportunity, and I know you will be great people and
totally not use Tymeshit for filling in your working hours because that would be way too easy and would look way too
real.
